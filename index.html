            “WHEN ONE TREATS PEOPLE WITH BENEVOLENCE, JUSTICE, AND
            RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND REPOSES CONFIDENCE IN THEM, THE ARMY WILL
            BE UNITED IN MIND AND ALL WILL BE HAPPY TO SERVE THEIR
            LEADERS.” ―SUN TZU

            <p>WHO IS THE GENERAL SUN TZU?</p>
            <h1>THE GREATEST MILLITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
            <p>The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu
                was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later
                Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu
                was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was
                born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was
                active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu
                in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun
                Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War.
                The Art of War was one of the most widely read military
                treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of
                constant war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi,
                Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast
                expanse of fertile territory in <span>Eastern China.</span></p>
